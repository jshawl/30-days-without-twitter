It's surprisingly not as difficult as I thought it would be. I often pull out my phone
every 10 minutes or so and unconsciously flip through screens looking for that
twitter icon before I realize that it's not there.

The world seems quieter and feels like it's slowing down.

I wrote a new blog post! I think knowing that I have no way (twitter) to tell people about it
has encouraged me to care less about what other people think, and just ship.

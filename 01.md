I need some creative outlet while I'm not tweeting. I feel like I have lots of good things to say,
but would feel uncomfortable emailing someone directly.

So I've started a GitHub repo to journal my thoughts and experiences! This will also help keep my streak going.

## Code School

I've recently enrolled in a [Code School](http://codeschool.com/) course, and am taking the javascript path. I'm currently on level 4 of "The Anatomy of Backbone.js" and these courses are fantastic!

The intro video songs are entertaining and the code challenges are relevant to today's problems. I highly recommend checking out Code School if you want to up your skills in one area or another.

**FYI** I'm planning to take the ruby path in the next couple of weeks. Would anyone like to join me? I'd love to collaborate and learn something new.

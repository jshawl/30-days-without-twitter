I need some creative outlet while I'm not tweeting. I feel like I have lots of good things to say,
but would feel uncomfortable emailing someone directly.

So I've started a GitHub repo to journal my thoughts and experiences! This will also help keep my streak going.

## Code School

I've recently enrolled in a [Code School](http://codeschool.com/) course, and am taking the javascript path. I'm currently on level 4 of "The Anatomy of Backbone.js" and these courses are fantastic!

The intro video songs are entertaining and the code challenges are relevant to today's problems. I highly recommend checking out Code School if you want to up your skills in one area or another.

**FYI** I'm planning to take the ruby path in the next couple of weeks. Would anyone like to join me? I'd love to collaborate and learn something new.

## Discourse & Docker

I've been vetting [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/) as a communication platform for future classes and communities I'm involved with, and was impressed to see Discource offers *only* a [Docker-based install](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-digital-ocean.md). The future is here! Now I just need to learn Docker.
